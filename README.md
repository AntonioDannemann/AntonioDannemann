Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub Page!
My name is Antonio Dannemann and I've been working in architecture for most of my like. However, I've recently made the decision to transition into the tech industry, specifically web development ðŸ’» because I'm fascinated by the endless possibilities and opportunities it offers.

As someone who's always eager to learn and explore new things, I'm constantly seeking out new challenges and exciting experiences. That's why I decided to take on the challenge of a web development bootcamp at @Le Wagon, where I acquired a whole new set of skills and worked on some amazing projects ðŸš€.

Now that I've completed the program, I'm ready to embark on a new adventure and take my tech skills to the next level. I can't wait to see what the future holds!

Throughout my incredible journey, I had the privilege of collaborating with an exceptional team of individuals to develop two remarkable projects that I'm truly proud of:

  - [Rentart (airbnb clone)](https://github.com/wJoenn/rentart) - _platform for renting pieces of art_

  - [Artify](https://github.com/wJoenn/artify) - _Website designed for mobile with Ruby on Rails where it is possible to take a picture of a monument or landmark anywhere in the world and get information about it_

ðŸ”­ Currently I'm focused on improving the skills I learned in the Bootcamp and become a amazing Front-end developer ðŸ’ª
